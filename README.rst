Railworks Dispatcher
====================

Creates a work order by choosing a random scenario from your Railworks folder.

Setup
-----

Place in the same folder as your `railworks.exe`.


Usage
-----

Unpack using 7Zip or RW-Tools all the routes and scenarios you want to be scanned.
Since 2014 DTG have started packing some assets in loseless ZIP files with .ap extension
which Dispatcher is not able to look through at the moment for performance reasons.
This has been described in detail by Mike, the author of RW-Tools, in his
`AP file tutorial <http://www.rstools.info/RW_Tools_and_APfiles.pdf>`_.

Run from console - a `WorkOrder.html` file will be created with a description of your duties.
